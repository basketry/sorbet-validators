# Sorbet Validators

[Basketry generator](https://github.com/basketry) for generating [Sorbet](https://sorbet.org/) validation methods. This parser can be coupled with any Basketry parser. It is recommended to use this generator alongside the [`@basketry/sorbet`](https://github.com/basketry/sorbet) generator.

## Quick Start

The following example converts a "Swagger" doc into [Sorbet](https://sorbet.org/) types:

1. Save `https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json` as `petstore.json` in the root of your project.
1. Install packages: `npm install -g basketry @basketry/swagger-2 @basketry/sorbet @basketry/sorbet-validators`
1. Generate code: `basketry --source petstore.json --parser @basketry/swagger-2 --generators @basketry/sorbet @basketry/sorbet-validators --output src`

When the last step is run, basketry will parse the source file (`petstore.json`) using the specified parser (`@basketry/swagger-2`) and then run each specified generator writing the output folder (`src`).

## Folder Structure

This generator writes `validators.rb` and `validation_erorr.rb` files in a folder structure compatable with the files and modules generated by [`@basketry/sorbet`](https://github.com/basketry/sorbet#folder-structure).

Example config without options:

```json
{
  "source": "petstore.json",
  "parser": "@basketry/swagger-2",
  "generators": ["@basketry/sorbet", "@basketry/sorbet-valiators"],
  "output": "app/lib"
}
```

Resulting output (including files from [`@basketry/sorbet`](https://github.com/basketry/sorbet)):

```
my_project/
├─ app/
│  ├─ lib/
│  │  ├─ petstore/
│  │  │  ├─ v1/
│  │  │  │  ├─ some_enum_a.rb
│  │  │  │  ├─ some_enum_b.rb
│  │  │  │  ├─ some_interface_a.rb
│  │  │  │  ├─ some_interface_b.rb
│  │  │  │  ├─ some_type_a.rb
│  │  │  │  ├─ some_type_b.rb
│  │  │  │  ├─ validation_error.rb   <- Generated by @basketry/sorbet-validators
│  │  │  │  ├─ validators.rb         <- Generated by @basketry/sorbet-validators
│  │  ├─ .gitattributes
├─ basketry.config.json
├─ petstore.json
```

## Options

All sorbet validator generator options are namespaced within a `sorbet` property. This generator's options include all options accepted by `@basketry/sorbet`. For this reason, it is recommended that all `sorbet` options be defined as common options to ensure that code generated by all sorbet-related generators use the same module and folder structure conventions.

Example config:

```json
{
  "source": "petstore.json",
  "parser": "@basketry/swagger-2",
  "generators": ["@basketry/sorbet", "@basketry/sorbet-validators"],
  "output": "src",
  "options": {
    "sorbet": {
      "runtime": false,
      "rubocopDisable": ["Style/IfUnlessModifier", "Layout/EndAlignment"]
    }
  }
}
```

### `runtime`

This option controls whether or not to write validation logic also enforced by the [Sorbet runtime checks](https://sorbet.org/docs/runtime). If you have enabled the Sorbet runtime, this generator does not need to write certain parts of the validation code.

To depend _only_ on these validators, set `runtime` to `false`. The default is `true`.

Example usage:

```json
{
  "options": {
    "sorbet": {
      "runtime": false
    }
  }
}
```

### `rubocopDisable`

Your project may include RuboCop rules that enforce different styles and conventions that the code generated by this generator. You can supply a list of rules to disable with the `rubocopDisable` options. These rules are ignored only within the `validators.rb` file.

Example usage:

```json
{
  "options": {
    "sorbet": {
      "rubocopDisable": ["Style/IfUnlessModifier", "Layout/EndAlignment"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Snapshots

An example of generated sorbet code can be found as a test snapshot at [`/src/snapshot/`](./src/snapshot/).

## For contributors:

### Run this project

1.  Install packages: `npm ci`
1.  Build the code: `npm run build`
1.  Run it! `npm start`

Note that the `lint` script is run prior to `build`. Auto-fixable linting or formatting errors may be fixed by running `npm run fix`.

### Create and run tests

1.  Add tests by creating files with the `.test.ts` suffix
1.  Run the tests: `npm t`
1.  Test coverage can be viewed at `/coverage/lcov-report/index.html`

### Publish a new package version

1. Ensure latest code is published on the `main` branch.
1. Create the new version number with `npm version {major|minor|patch}`
1. Push the branch and the version tag: `git push origin main --follow-tags`

The [publish workflow](https://github.com/basketry/sorbet-validators/actions/workflows/publish.yml) will build and pack the new version then push the package to NPM. Note that publishing requires write access to the `main` branch.
